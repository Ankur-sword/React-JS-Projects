>> What is JSX?

> JSX stands for JavaScript XML. 
It is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their 
JavaScript files. JSX is used primarily with the **React** library to create reusable UI components. 
JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files, which is then compiled into 
regular JavaScript at runtime. This makes it easier to write and add HTML in React, and also makes 
the code more readable and maintainable.
